Hi, I'm Klanec. I have a degree in Computer Science, an OSCP and I'm a big nerd for languages and music. I speak English, Dutch, conversational Japanese and I'm busy learning Swedish. 

On the security side, I'm interested in penetration testing, digital forensics, OSINT and Cybercrime but I dabble in a lot of topics, the details of which you can find on this blog here. I participate in CTFs with the team RGBsec.
